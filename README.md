We are NullPointerException and our members are Furkan Bulgur, Murat Han Aydoğan,
Gülay Canbaloğlu, Talha Enes Güler and Burhan Özer Çavdar. In this project we created the
KuVid Game which is a 2D JavaSwing platform game. Our aim in this project is to learn and apply
object oriented programming principles, UML, GRASP and GOF patterns such as creator,
controller, low coupling, high cohesion, factory, observer etc. These patterns helped us to design
objects and assign the responsibilities between them in a way that reusability is maximized.
